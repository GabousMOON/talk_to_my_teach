<h1>Teacher Resources</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    Teachers are easily one of the most underappreciated roles in our society. They lay the cornerstones of our society,
    yet more often then not, their compensation is criminally underwhelming. There are challenges that are part of the
    job that you were probably not very well trained for and you might feel unprepared for those types of situations. In
    the research community, a consensus has been reached that "Educators are seen to have an impact on student
    achievement, motivation, adjustment, behavior, and social-emotional well-being. Moreover, as teachers are
    seen as a vital element of school climate, the interactions between teachers and students can have a significant
    effect on students' success‚Äù<a

    enable you educators with the right
    resources to tackle the toughest situations when it comes to communicating with students, parents, or
    administration.
