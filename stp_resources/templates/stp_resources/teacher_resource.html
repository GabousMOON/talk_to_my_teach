<h1>Teacher Resources</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    Teachers are easily one of the most underappreciated roles in our society. They lay the cornerstones of our society,
    yet more often then not, their compensation is criminally underwhelming. There are challenges that are part of the
    job that you were probably not very well trained for and you might feel unprepared for those types of situations.
    The goal of this page is to enable you educators with the right resources to tackle the toughest situations when it
    comes to communicating with students, parents, or administration.
