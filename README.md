# WARNING
<p>It is a website that is kind of just a concept for now, but if i have time/resources/energy, I will continue to scale it up. This is my first django app and I don't know squat about cybersecurity so please do not put anything that resembles personal information on this website. It will help me sleep at night.</p>

## Okay now that that is out of the way...
<p>This website was built for my communications class and I also wanted to learn a webframework, so I hope i did everything right. So as an initial project, this isn't too bad no? I must give credit to Corey Shaefer and his django tutorial series on youtube. Seriously, look it up, because it was the first django tutorial I watched that actually made me feel like I kind of knew what I was doing, (except for class based views, still have no idea what the heck was going on there). I totally stole his css too. I did modify a couple things but honestly, I just know python, and I don't care enough about html/css to learn anything fancy for now. maybe later though.</p>

## General Functionality
<p>This website allows you to make an account, and post questions about communicating with your teacher or your kid's teacher. There are a collection of resources on the website that will direct you towards some really good articles on how to handle various situations. I do plan on adding to this website over time, just not as much right now because this was a school project that wasn't even for a CS class, heck, I'm not even going into webdev, I'm going into Data Science.</p>
<p> Feel free to make an account, however this website is being hosted on the free-tier of python anywhere.com, so if I'm lucky, I might be able to have like 20 people on it at once lol</p>

## Thank you!
<p>If this is in anyway helpful to you, then I'm glad. If you have any ideas on how to improve the website, or anyone has any good explanation for class based views in django, then PLEASE let me know. Thanks for checking out my little project</p>
